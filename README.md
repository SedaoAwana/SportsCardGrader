## Usage

### Command Line Interface

```bash
# Analyze a single card image
sports-card-grader analyze card.jpg

# Analyze with detailed technical output
sports-card-grader analyze card.jpg --detailed

# Analyze all images in a directory
sports-card-grader analyze /path/to/cards/ --directory

# Output results in JSON format
sports-card-grader analyze card.jpg --output json

# Use different grading company standards
sports-card-grader analyze card.jpg --company BGS
```

### Python API

```python
from sports_card_grader import CardAnalyzer, GradingSystem

# Initialize analyzer and grading system
analyzer = CardAnalyzer()
grader = GradingSystem()

# Load and analyze a card image
analyzer.load_image("path/to/card.jpg")
analysis_results = analyzer.analyze_all()

# Generate grading report
report = grader.generate_detailed_report(analysis_results)

print(f"Predicted Grade: {report['predicted_grade']}/10")
print(f"Overall Score: {report['overall_score']}/100")
```

## Analysis Components

### 1. Edge Quality (25% weight)
- Detects edge smoothness and sharpness
- Identifies potential wear or damage
- Analyzes card boundary integrity

### 2. Corner Assessment (30% weight)
- Evaluates corner sharpness using Harris corner detection
- Measures gradient strength around corners
- Detects rounding or damage

### 3. Surface Analysis (30% weight)
- Identifies scratches and surface defects
- Analyzes texture uniformity
- Evaluates print quality and clarity

### 4. Centering Evaluation (15% weight)
- Measures card alignment within borders
- Analyzes border uniformity
- Detects off-center or miscut issues

## Grading Scale

| Grade | Score Range | Description |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| 10    | 95-100      | Gem Mint    |
| 9     | 85-94       | Mint        |
| 8     | 75-84       | Near Mint-Mint |
| 7     | 65-74       | Near Mint   |
| 6     | 55-64       | Excellent-Near Mint |
| 5     | 45-54       | Excellent   |
| 4     | 35-44       | Very Good-Excellent |
| 3     | 25-34       | Very Good   |
| 2     | 15-24       | Good        |
| 1     | 0-14        | Poor        |

üèÜ SPORTS CARD GRADING ANALYSIS REPORT
====================================

üìä OVERALL GRADE: 9/10 (Mint)
üìà Overall Score: 87.5/100
üîç Confidence Level: High

üìã COMPONENT BREAKDOWN:
--------------------------------
       Edges:  85.0/100 (Grade: 9/10, Weight:  25%)
     Corners:  92.0/100 (Grade: 9/10, Weight:  30%)
     Surface:  88.0/100 (Grade: 9/10, Weight:  30%)
   Centering:  82.0/100 (Grade: 8/10, Weight:  15%)

‚úÖ STRENGTHS: Corners
‚ö†Ô∏è  AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT: Centering

üí° SUGGESTIONS:
   ‚Ä¢ Card shows excellent quality across all criteria

üè¢ PSA STANDARDS COMPARISON:
   Meets Gem Mint Standard: ‚ùå No
   Meets Mint Standard: ‚úÖ Yes
```

## Technical Implementation

The system uses computer vision techniques including:

- **Canny Edge Detection** for edge analysis
- **Harris Corner Detection** for corner evaluation
- **Morphological Operations** for surface defect detection
- **Contour Analysis** for shape and centering assessment
- **Gradient Analysis** for sharpness measurement

## Development Status

- ‚úÖ Core analysis algorithms implemented
- ‚úÖ Grading system with weighted scoring
- ‚úÖ CLI interface
- ‚úÖ Multiple output formats
- ‚úÖ Grading company standards support
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive error handling
- ‚úÖ **Debugging protocols with tracing and causality tracking**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Currently includes fallback implementation for environments without OpenCV

## Debugging Features

The Sports Card Grader includes comprehensive debugging capabilities:

### Active Tracing
- Function entry/exit logging with the `@trace_function` decorator
- Automatic timing information for performance analysis
- Request ID tracking for causality across function calls

### Usage Examples

```python
from sports_card_grader import configure_debug, get_logger
import logging

# Enable debug mode with full tracing
configure_debug(
    enabled=True,
    trace_enabled=True,
    performance_tracking=True,
    log_level=logging.DEBUG
)

# Use logger with request ID tracking
logger = get_logger(__name__)
logger.info("Starting analysis")
```

### Wolf Fence Algorithm
Binary search debugging to isolate issues:

```python
from sports_card_grader import WolfFenceDebugger

debugger = WolfFenceDebugger()
debugger.checkpoint("Step 1", lambda: condition_check(), {"data": value})
debugger.checkpoint("Step 2", lambda: another_check())
debugger.summary()  # Shows which checkpoint failed first
```

### Test with Debug Mode

```bash
# Run tests with full debug output
python test_demo.py --debug

# Run examples with performance tracking
python examples.py
```

### API Debug Endpoints

- `GET /api/debug/stats` - System statistics and analysis metrics
- `POST /api/debug/configure` - Enable/disable debug mode
- `GET /api/analysis/{id}/debug` - Detailed debug info for specific analysis

## Future Enhancements

- Machine learning models for improved accuracy
- Web interface for easy access
- Batch processing capabilities
- Historical grade tracking
- Integration with grading company APIs
- Mobile app development
